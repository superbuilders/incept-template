<philosophy>
- Deterministic: All variability must derive from the provided \`seed\`.
- Pure: No side effects, logging, network, file access, or thrown errors—guard invariants so execution always returns deterministic data.
- Declarative: Construct widgets and interactions via typed helpers, not ad-hoc literals.
- Programmatic feedback: Derive hints from computed values, never hardcode literal feedback strings lifted from the QTI stem.
- Auditable: Keep identifiers, step titles, and feedback snippets traceable to computed values.
