## Why this example is harmful

- The steps are vague (“Review the procedure”, “State the final result”) and don’t give the learner concrete actions, violating our requirement for three actionable, concept-driven moves.
- Misconceptions are treated as step titles (“Why this is wrong”) instead of being handled in the preamble, so the actual instruction time is wasted.
- Every branch repeats the final answer inside the steps, defeating the purpose of the new solution block and encouraging answer-reveals too early.
- There is no MathML walk-through of the transformations (aligning denominators, scaling numerators) that students need to see.
- Tone is perfunctory and directive rather than supportive; the copy fails to coach the learner through a correction.
- The preambles never cite the learner’s actual choice or the computed values—they reuse the same generic wording for every path, so the student never hears “you picked 5/12” or “the correct denominator is 12.” Parameterization is ignored completely.
- Solution boxes ramble on with extra coaching (“Keep the scaling factor matched…”) instead of delivering the required one-sentence reveal. The final answer should stand on its own.
