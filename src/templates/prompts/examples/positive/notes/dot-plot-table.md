Highlights:
- Seeded randomness synchronizes the story setup (name, subject) with axis ranges and dot counts, yielding deterministic but varied instances.
- Dot plot data generation enforces at least one dot and captures per-tick counts directly for both the widget and table.
- Dropdown options derive from the observed counts with a capped extension, keeping choices plausible while covering the actual answers.
- Binary feedback dimensions enumerate all correct/incorrect combinations, pairing each with targeted guidance that references the seeded labels.
- Shared pedagogy walks learners through reading the plot, tracing requested labels, and validating totals without revealing the numeric answers prematurely.
- Feedback preambles now restate the learner’s exact entries for each highlighted label and cite the column counts that prove whether those entries are correct, matching the preamble checklist in the global feedback guidance.
