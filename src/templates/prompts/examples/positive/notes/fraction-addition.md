Highlights:
- Deterministic seeding drives both operands, distractors, and widget shading.
- Feedback recomputes the math operations step-by-step instead of echoing static text.
- Widget construction matches interaction identifiers and response keys consistently.
- Demonstrates defensive handling of duplicate distractors with `uniqueChoices`.
- Preambles now spell out the learner’s selected fraction and the exact arithmetic mistake (or success), aligning with the feedback guidance checklist.
